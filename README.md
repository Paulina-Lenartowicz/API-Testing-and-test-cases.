API testing. 

My education program encompassed studying API testing. Here you can see the results of my working in Postman.

# Simple Books API
This API allows to book a book and work with the orders. 
Collection in Postman: [Books.postman_collection.jso](Books.postman_collection.json)


Restful-booker API
This API allows to create and work with bookings.
Collection in Postman: `Booking.postman_collection.json`


During the internship I wrote test cases of the Publigo website- which allows selling courses. The test cases written by me are attached. After importing to JIRA, I was also responsible for running tests.

Test cases: `Test cases`
